# Notification System

This repo started out as a coding challenge.

* run `yarn` to install the package's dependencies
* run `yarn start` to start webpack-dev-server on port 3000
* run `yarn build` to compile the application
* run `yarn test --coverage` to run the tests and view the test coverage
* if you add a commit, `yarn fix:script` and `yarn fix:style` will automatically lint the code
* the linters can also be manually be dry-run with `yarn check:script` and `yarn check:style`

## ToDo

* [X] useReducer
* [ ] add missing unit tests
* [X] wrap everything in a context provider (global state)
